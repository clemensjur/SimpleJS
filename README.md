# SimpleJS
A simple, light-weight, component-based Javascript "Framework" I wrote because Angular was too heavy-weight for small applications

### Usage
To use the framework just create a new HTML-file in the "components"-folder and give an already existing element inside of "app.html" an id with the name of the HTML-file
