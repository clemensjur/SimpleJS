# SimpleJS
A simple, light-weight, component-based Javascript "Framework" I wrote because Angular was too heavy-weight for small applications

### Installation
Just clone the repo from Github and you're good to go!

### Usage
To use the framework just create a new HTML-file in the "components"-folder and give an already existing element inside of "app.html" a class with the name of the HTML-file

### TODO
- [ ] Fix recursion issue in components
- [ ] Add functionality for subfolders in the components directory
