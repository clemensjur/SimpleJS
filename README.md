# SimpleJS
A simple, light-weight, component-based Javascript "Framework" I wrote because Angular was too heavy-weight for small applications

### Installation
Just clone the repo from Github and you're good to go!

### Usage
To use the framework just create a new HTML-file in the "components"-folder and give an already existing element inside of "app.html" a class-attribute with the name of the HTML-file. When assigning more than one class to an element pay attention to the order of the classes the respective components will be appended to the element in the same order.

### TODO
- [ ] Fix recursion issue in components
- [ ] Add functionality for subfolders in the components directory
- [ ] Add templates folder for already prepared components to be ready to use
- [x] Add functionality for a HTML element to have multiple components associated with it
- [ ] Switch from PHP tp NodeJS
